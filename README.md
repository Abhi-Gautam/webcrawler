# Web Crawler Project

## üöÄ Project Overview

A modern, scalable web crawler built with microservices architecture, designed to demonstrate distributed systems principles and data pipeline engineering. This crawler efficiently fetches, processes, and stores web content while maintaining high availability and horizontal scalability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Fetcher Service**: Retrieves web pages using Scrapy
- **Parser Service**: Extracts structured data from HTML content
- **Storage Service**: Persists parsed data to MongoDB
- **Messaging Layer**: Kafka for reliable service communication
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for URL deduplication and rate limiting

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Scrapy, Flask/FastAPI (for API)
- **Databases**: MongoDB, Redis
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Frontend** (optional): React/Vue.js

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-crawler.git
cd web-crawler

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Check services status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Configuration
The crawler can be configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| START_URLS | Comma-separated list of seed URLs | https://www.example.com |
| DEPTH_LIMIT | Maximum crawl depth | 1 |
| CONCURRENT_REQUESTS | Number of concurrent requests | 16 |

## üìä Performance Metrics

Once fully implemented, the crawler is expected to achieve:
- Throughput: 50+ pages/second per fetcher instance
- Latency: <500ms average processing time per page
- Scalability: Linear scaling with additional fetcher instances
- Storage: Efficient storage with approximately 100KB per page (compressed)

## üß™ Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest

# Integration tests
pytest --integration

# Load testing
locust -f tests/locustfile.py
```
